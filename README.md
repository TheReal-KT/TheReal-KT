Hi Khuluza! 👋

I'm Khuluza Tshabalala, a tech enthusiast from South Africa currently pursuing a Software Engineering degree at Eduvos. My journey into tech began in high school, where my fascination with coding and machines grew. I thrive on curiosity and collaboration, always keen on sharing knowledge and learning from others. Java, Python and JavaScript are my go-to languages, with Python fueling my interest in machine learning and JavaScript making web and mobile development exciting. Blockchain technology has also captured my attention, leading me to invest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, with dreams of contributing to this revolutionary field.

My passion for tech keeps me busy, whether it's building personal projects, exploring new areas like web development, or staying ahead with coursework. I believe in staying productive, even during holidays, and constantly push myself to learn and innovate. My journey has been one of discovery and growth, and I'm excited about the endless possibilities that the tech world holds for me!
