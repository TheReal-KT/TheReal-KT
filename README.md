Hello! My name is Khuluza Tshabalala, and I hail from the vibrant country of South Africa. My journey into the tech world began at Eduvos, where I am pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. The tech space has always been my passion, especially coding, as it presents endless opportunities to learn and grow.

I’m someone who thrives on curiosity and collaboration. I love sharing knowledge with others while also being open to learning from their experiences. Having recently completed my first year of university, I’ve made it a point to stay productive even during holidays. Whether it’s creating personal projects or getting a head start on upcoming coursework, I’m always keeping busy – and, yes, sometimes working ahead of the class! 😅

At the moment, I’m focused on building projects using Python and JavaScript. Python is my go-to language, especially because of my growing interest in machine learning. However, I’ve also been exploring web and mobile development, and I’m excited about where this curiosity might lead me. JavaScript holds a special place as my second favourite language after Python, thanks to its versatility and dynamic nature.

Interestingly, my love for programming began during high school, where I studied architecture. Even while preparing for exams, I couldn’t resist watching tech videos and diving into how machines work. This fascination has since expanded to include blockchain technology, a field I’m increasingly drawn to. Blockchain’s decentralised nature and its ability to ensure transparency, security, and efficiency across industries are qualities I find revolutionary.

I’ve even invested in a few cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as I see their potential to disrupt traditional finance and reshape the global economy. Beyond investments, I’m intrigued by how blockchain can be applied beyond finance—in areas like healthcare, supply chain management, and even voting systems. Who knows? Maybe one day, I’ll contribute to the field by creating my own blockchain platform or even launching a cryptocurrency that addresses real-world challenges.

In essence, I’m a tech enthusiast with a deep love for coding and an insatiable curiosity for how things work. My journey so far has been one of discovery and innovation, and I’m eager to see where it takes me next!
